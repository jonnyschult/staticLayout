I decided to challenge myself with the Wizarding World site.
Lots of moving part, etc. I thought it would be challenging. 
It was, but infomative. 
I couldn't get the nav bar to stay opaque after scrolling.
It seems you need JavaScript for that, and nav links with arrow and for the sliding menu. 
Also, they updated the last photo on the page this morning. In redoing it, I seem to have created an error in my page.
Now the whole page zooms in as it loads, instead of just the top content. I'll trouble shoot it later. 
Hopefully it's acceptable as is.
