INITIAL:
I THOUGHT THIS ONE WOULD BE CHALLENGE. I WAS RIGHT. SOME PROPRIETERY FONTS I COULDN'T (WOULDN'T) BUY AND SOME SCRIPTS I COULDN'T GET TO WORK.
RESULT:
-NO DROPDOWN MENU ON NAV
-NO SLIDE MENU
-NO MOVING STARFIELD
-NO HEADER OPAQUING WHEN SCROLLING
I TRIED TO FIND WORKAROUNDS, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FEASIBLE. 
FIXED 9:19 CST:
-PAGE UPDATED SO I UPDATED PHOTO;
-BETTER USE OF POSITIONING TOOLS
-ZOOM NOW ONLY WORKS ON TOP CONTAINER AS IN THE WEBSITE
